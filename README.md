# Teacher Tap
Teacher Tap is designed for Secondary school teachers to input student data after sitting an exam. The user is prompted to input the student's name, predicted grade and exam score. The programme will then calculate the grade the student got for the exam, whether the student is on target or not and will also generate an intervention strategy for the student. 
If the student requires an email home, the programme will automatically generate a message that the teacher can copy and paste without having to type it out themselves. If students require a phonecall home, the programme will add their name to a list that the teacher can check off once they have made the relevant phonecalls.

The concept is that the teacher only has to enter a few simple values to the programme and a lot of their workload is then carried out for them. 

## User Stories
- As a first time user, I want the input system to be simple and easy to follow.
- As a first time user, I want to be corrected and given feedback if I make a mistake, as it is an unfamiliar system.
- As a continued user, I want to reduce my workload and only need to enter a few values.

## Bugs


## Testing


## Deployment

App was deployed to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
1. A Heroku account was created.
2. In GitPod (where the code was written), the command "pip3 freeze > requirements.txt" was put into the terminal. This created a list of requirements that the project needs to run.

## Future improvements
Future improvements would include the ability to delete data that had been previously entered or update data if a student resat the exam. 
There would also be an option to add the class name of the student and have separate worksheets for separate classes. 

## Credits

My project was inspired by the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/)'s Love Sandwiches project from the Full Stack Diploma course. I changed the purpose of the programme, adapted the code and wrote my own functions to make my project unique.
